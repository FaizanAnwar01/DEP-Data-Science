## Tasks

### Customer Segmentation for a Retail Store

**Objective**: Use transaction data to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

**Description**: Analyze historical sales data to identify distinct groups of customers. This can help in targeted marketing strategies, personalized promotions, and improving customer retention.

**Key Steps**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means)
- Visualization of customer segments

### Predicting House Prices

**Objective**: Build a model to predict house prices based on various features.

**Description**: Use a dataset containing information about houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location) to create a predictive model that estimates the price of a house.

**Key Steps**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training (e.g., linear regression)
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning

### Sentiment Analysis for Social Media Posts

**Objective**: Analyze social media posts to determine the sentiment.

**Description**: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of social media posts. This can help in understanding public opinion and customer feedback.

**Key Steps**:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Text analysis and feature extraction
- Sentiment classification (e.g., using pre-trained models or custom classifiers)
- Visualization of sentiment analysis results

### Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

**Objective**: Detect anomalies in network traffic that may indicate potential security breaches.

**Description**: Analyze network traffic data to identify patterns and detect anomalies that could signify cyber threats or unusual activities.

**Key Steps**:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature extraction (e.g., packet size, time intervals)
- Anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders)
- Evaluation and validation of detected anomalies
